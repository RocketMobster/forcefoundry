## Migration Notes


## Roadmap

### Immediate Next Steps
- Add a button to the character generator that copies a generated character in a format suitable for pasting into external AI image generators (e.g., Stable Diffusion, Midjourney) to create a portrait outside the app.
- Add device detection for desktop vs mobile UI optimization

### Future Considerations
- Possibly add a portrait function that pulls a random portrait JPG or PNG from a data folder for the character's class and species and displays it. This is a potential feature under consideration.

### For Users
- Character Generator: Now includes species selection dropdown
- New Feature: Access the Name Generator via the header navigation
- Improved: More accurate species-specific name generation
- Better: Faster loading without external API dependencies

### For Developers
- Breaking: `firstNames.json` and `lastNames.json` can now be safely removed
- New: Species data structure in 5 separate JSON files
- Enhanced: Error handling patterns for production readiness
- Ready: Framework for easy species expansion
