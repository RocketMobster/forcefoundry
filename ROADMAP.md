# üåå ForceFoundry Development Roadmap
# üö© Immediate Next Steps

- Remove the AI image portrait functionality entirely, including the toggle and note on the character generator page.
- Add a button to the character generator that copies a generated character in a format suitable for pasting into external AI image generators (e.g., Stable Diffusion, Midjourney) to create a portrait outside the app.

# üîÆ Future Considerations

- Possibly add a portrait function that pulls a random portrait JPG or PNG from a data folder for the character's class and species and displays it. This is a potential feature under consideration.

## üîç Implementation Notes

### **Data Architecture Decisions**
- **Pros of JSON files**: Easy to edit, version control friendly, user-customizable
- **Cons**: Slightly more complex loading, need validation
- **Decision**: Proceed with JSON files for maximum flexibility

### **Force System Design**
```javascript
// Proposed Force system structure
const forceTypes = {
  'Non-Force User': { canHaveLightsaber: false, forceAbilities: [] },
  'Force Sensitive': { canHaveLightsaber: false, forceAbilities: ['basic'] },
  'Force User': { canHaveLightsaber: true, forceAbilities: ['advanced'] }
}

const lightsaberColors = {
  Jedi: ['Blue', 'Green', 'Purple', 'Yellow'],
  Sith: ['Red', 'Crimson'],
  Other: ['White', 'Black', 'Orange']
}
```

### **Settings Page Structure**
- **Data Management**: Upload/manage JSON files
- **Display Preferences**: Theme, layout options
- **Generation Settings**: Default quantities, probability adjustments
- **Export Options**: PDF templates, file formats

### **Technical Considerations**
- **PDF Generation**: Use `jsPDF` with custom templates
- **File Upload**: Validate JSON structure before allowing use
- **API Integration**: Implement retry logic and fallbacks for SubNP
- **State Management**: Consider upgrading to useReducer for complex state
